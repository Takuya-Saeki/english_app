Frankly, I wish the BIG3 (Takeshi, Akashiya Sanma, and Tamori) would retire soon (laughs). It's sort of difficult for us to quit too,' he admitted. 'They were really in the way when I was younger, but now that I've turned sixty, the fact that they are still around actually motivates me,' he expressed his respect."
