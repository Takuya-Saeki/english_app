He explained his guess of Daigo being third by saying, "There might be opinions like it's a problem if a boss gets drunk." He also shared that recently, a friend saw someone collapsed near the police station at Shinagawa Station late at night. The officer was asking, "Are you okay?" On a closer look, it was Daigo. He's still doing such things.

At this unexpected reveal, Daigo laughed. The co-stars were surprised, and Hakata Daikichi, thinking it was an old story, asked when it happened. Yamauchi immediately answered, "No, no, it was two weeks ago." Daigo then made them laugh by saying he has a bit of awareness that if he's going to collapse, being near a police station is better. Someone will surely help.
